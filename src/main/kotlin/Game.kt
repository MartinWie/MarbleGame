 * - Players start with 10 marbles each
 * - Each round, one player (the "placer") hides some marbles
 * - Other players guess if the hidden count is EVEN or ODD
 * - Correct guessers split the placed marbles from the placer
 * - Wrong guessers lose marbles equal to the placed amount to the placer
 * - A player with 0 marbles becomes a spectator
 * - Last player with marbles wins
 *
 * ## Connection Handling

 * If they don't reconnect, their marbles are distributed to remaining players.
