/**
 * Global singleton managing all active games in the application.
 *
 * Provides thread-safe operations for creating, retrieving, and removing games.
 * Uses [ConcurrentHashMap] to ensure safe concurrent access from multiple coroutines
 * handling player connections.
 *
 * ## Automatic Cleanup
 * Games are automatically removed when:
 * - A finished game (GAME_OVER) has been inactive for 1 hour
 * - An unfinished game has been inactive for 4 hours
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 * ```kotlin
 * // Create a new game
 * val game = GameManager.createGame(creatorSessionId = "session-123")
 *
 * // Retrieve an existing game
 * val existingGame = GameManager.getGame(game.id)
 *
 * // Find which game a player is in
 * val playerGame = GameManager.findGameByPlayer("session-456")
 *
 * // Remove a game when it's finished
 * GameManager.removeGame(game.id)
 * ```
 *
 * @see Game
