 * Represents a player in the Marble Game.

 * - A unique session ID (from their browser session)
 * - A display name
 * - A marble count (starts at 10, game ends when reaching 0)
 * - Connection state tracking for realtime sessions
 * - A channel for receiving game state updates
 * - A language preference for UI translations
 *
 * The player tracks their connection state with a grace period system:
 * when a player disconnects (e.g., closes tab, loses network), they have
 * [DISCONNECT_GRACE_PERIOD_MS] to reconnect before being removed from the game.
 *
 * @property sessionId Unique identifier for this player's session
 * @property name Display name shown to other players
 * @property marbles Current marble count (0 = spectator)
 * @property currentGuess The player's guess for the current round (EVEN or ODD)
 * @property channel Coroutine channel for signaling outbound updates to this player
 * @property lang Language code for UI translations (e.g., "en", "de")
